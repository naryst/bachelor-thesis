    My thesis aims to develop a system that automates the process of generating commit messages. The results achieved in deep learning have increased significantly over the last six years. This progress is especially noticeable in natural language processing (\textbf{NLP}). The generation of commit messages can be viewed as a neural machine translation task in NLP\@. It involves translating code into natural language to describe the changes made in the commit. I claim that considering the current progress in NLP, it is possible to generate descriptive commit messages from code modifications. 

    My work consists of a literature review, data collection and analysis, deep learning model training,  evaluation, and results discussion. Regarding the model training, I experimented with models of different sizes, an additional module to solve the problem with message style adoption, and an additional module to resolve the problem of limited context. During the literature review, metrics analysis is conducted to identify the most suitable metrics for generating commit messages. I also conducted the experiment to prove that my metrics make sense and correctly identify how good the generated message is. 
    
    In summary, my thesis includes the analysis of the problem from the data, metrics and model perspective. I also conducted experiments to reproduce the results from other papers. In addition, I proposed an idea to mitigate the problem of handling bit commits. At the end of my work, I evaluated all the models trained and made a conclusion about the current state of the commit messages generation.
